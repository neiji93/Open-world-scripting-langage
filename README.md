# Open-world-scripting-langage. New scripting langage suited for large scale open world games. The core program can be written in C++. We don't use models yet but equation and functions in physics.. The abstracts of the langage is not finished yet . We previously worked on NAvier stokes equations that leladed us to  rooms humidity as a complexified field. As we work sometimes on complexity, we are exctied to push forward everytime.. Then, we released d the current state of the art. We used models too much at the moment. The basics of our studies were to express equations as constants and to express our various perceptions. Physical laws govern life from the bottom but we can express everything yet. At the moment, we use E*U^2 = E* R^2 * I^2. Finally, this can be a key that suit other constants. This seems so exciting but we have results. The rest of the stuff is not my part. the lzst lines of  code added to this scripting langage powered by cpp for the core program are able to run faster than a c program. this is due to big systems architectures. Samples will be ready the july 5th. plus, this langage have supercomputer programming tools. i can extend my last chess engine too.
