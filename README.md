# Open-world-scripting-langage. New scripting langage suited for large scale open world games. The core program can be written in C++. We don't use models yet but equation and functions in physics.. The abstracts of the langage is not finished yet . We previously worked on NAvier stokes equations that leladed us to  rooms humidity as a complexified field. As we work sometimes on complexity, we are exctied to push forward everytime.. Then, we released d the current state of the art. We used models too much at the moment. The basics of our studies were to express equations as constants and to express our various perceptions. Physical laws govern life from the bottom but we can express everything yet. At the moment, we use E*U^2 = E* R^2 * I^2. Finally, this can be a key that suit other constants. This seems so exciting but we have results. The rest of the stuff is not my part. the lzst lines of  code added to this scripting langage powered by cpp for the core program are able to run faster than a c program. this is due to big systems architectures. Samples will be ready the july 5th. plus, this langage have supercomputer programming tools. you can use to create a chess engine powered by supercomputers and I can extend my last chess engine too. Memory mapping with E*U^2 = E* R^2 * I^2 and log(x) will be ready soon. There must be a way to use equations and not models. Yeah, I'm massively using log(x) but it is correct according to my researches in physics at the moment. In the far futur, I will have to find other ways. There are 2 files in this repository that are strongly esquisses. maybe it can be used with the ps5 and more. If the esquisse for the benefits of computer graphics in this langage is true, you can download my stuff at another repository I pt earlier. DX11Editor. But I don't know what github company did to this repository because it seems to be private. I have some things to fix in order to help you more.
